    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is Dave Smith and I've been a software developer for 17+ years. Over those years I've helped different organizations refine requirements, design and code solutions to enable or support the business. 
      My goal has been to produce high quality software where the code is easy to read, easy to change and easy to deploy. I love working in a team environment where we can share ideas and collectively work on a solution. I believe we do our best work when work when we work together.
      I am excited at the prospect of working at a product driven company.
